18:45
expanding in all directions ideas like
18:48
dark matter and dark energy were
18:49
developed based on Hubble's findings and
18:52
there have been adjustments along the
18:53
way like adding the concept of cosmic
18:56
inflation the cosmic inflation the
18:58
Theory suggests a rapid expansion in the
19:00
first fraction of a second after the big
19:02
bang ensuring a smooth and homogeneous
19:04
initial expansion however loopholes
19:07
persisted giving rise to the Multiverse
19:09
Theory proposing an infinite number of
19:12
universes despite these efforts to
19:14
clarify our universe's Evolution the
19:16
recent web Revelation challenges the
19:18
validity of The Big Bang Theory and
19:20
previous adjustments many scientists
19:22
think it's time to change how we
19:25
understand the universe they believe we
19:27
should stop using the old way of
19:28
thinking called the standard model and
19:31
start fresh when the standard model was
19:33
created we didn't have powerful tools
19:36
like the James web telescope this makes
19:38
some scientists think we should let go
19:40
of old ideas and make a completely new
19:43
model also astronomers and cosmologists
19:46
agree that we need a new way of thinking
19:48
but getting everyone to agree on it is
19:50
hard it's a challenge to make sure the
19:53
whole scientific Community is on the
19:55
same page but we can't just ignore the B
19:58
basic rules of physics as we search for
20:00
new answers even if the Big Bang Theory
20:03
turns out to be wrong scientists have
20:05
few choices they have to stick to it
20:07
until a better more advanced and widely
20:10
accepted idea comes along and that's all
20:13
