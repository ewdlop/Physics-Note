To conceptualize a more concrete approach to physics without traditional algebra, we can look at alternative methods and ideas proposed in scientific research. Here are some key insights:

Novel Methods for Differential Equations: An alternative to algebraic solutions in physics is the use of methods like the raising and lowering operator approach or group theoretical methods for solving differential equations, which are common in various physical problems. These approaches often focus on the symmetries of the problem rather than traditional algebraic methods (Gurappa, Panigrahi, Shreecharan, & Ranjani, 2001).

Numerov-Type Methods for Oscillating Solutions: An alternative to algebraic methods in physics can be found in Numerov-type methods for solving second-order initial value problems. These methods avoid the use of high accuracy interpolatory nodes, which are common in algebraic solutions, and instead use Taylor expansion at internal points (Simos, Famelis, & Tsitouras, 2003).

Algebraic Topology in Electromagnetics: Algebraic topology offers an alternative approach to model electromagnetic problems without relying on vector calculus and differential equations. This method leads directly to discrete formulation using global quantities, avoiding the need for vector calculus and interpolating local vector field quantities (Sankaran, 2017).

Stochastic Collocation and Galerkin Methods: These methods are used for linear differential algebraic equations, where uncertainties in parameters are modeled by random variables. The solutions are expanded in the polynomial chaos, offering an alternative to traditional algebraic methods (Pulch, 2014).

Implicit Constraint Approach (ICA): ICA is an alternative method for developing equations of motion in systems like mechanisms and robotic devices. It engages students more in the physics of the system by using only dynamic equilibrium conditions, forming ordinary differential equations rather than differential-algebraic equations (Sutherland, 2009).

Monte Carlo Method: This statistical approach is used for a class of problems in mathematical physics, particularly for the study of differential or integro-differential equations. It offers an alternative to traditional algebraic solutions by using probabilistic and statistical methods (Metropolis & Ulam, 1949).

These approaches demonstrate that while algebra is fundamental to conventional physics, there are diverse methodologies that can be explored for solving physical problems without relying solely on algebra.
