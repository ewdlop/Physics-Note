Strange Matter: So Stable it's Contagious 

Strange Matter Definition: Strange Matter is a form of matter that is extremely stable and potentially contagious, meaning it could transform all matter in the universe.

Composition of Normal Matter: Regular matter is composed of atoms, which consist of protons, neutrons, and electrons. Protons and neutrons are made from quarks.

Types of Quarks: There are six flavors of quarks: up, down, top, bottom, strange, and charm, with up and down quarks being the most common in normal matter.

Particles Formed by Quarks: Hadrons, including mesons (quark-antiquark pairs) and baryons (three quarks), are made from quarks. Most hadrons are unstable except for protons and neutrons.

Stability of Protons and Neutrons: Protons are incredibly stable, with a lifespan of

Introduction to Strange Matter: Strange Matter consists of strange quarks. While particles with strange quarks are generally unstable, Strange Matter in certain conditions is exceptionally stable.

Formation in Neutron Stars: Inside neutron stars, extreme pressure may break down neutrons into quarks, creating a dense quark soup. Some up quarks can transform into strange quarks, forming stable Strange Matter.

Lambda Hyperons: Strange Matter might form particles called Lambda hyperons, composed of one up quark, one down quark, and one strange quark.

Infectious Nature of Strange Matter: Strange Matter could theoretically convert normal matter into more Strange Matter, behaving almost like an infection.

Strange Matter in the Universe: If Strange Matter exists, it might be confined within neutron stars. However, collisions between neutron stars could eject Strange Matter fragments, called strangelets, into space.

Hypothesis Challenges: The existence of Strange Matter is uncertain. It may only be stable under extreme conditions, like inside neutron stars. Earth's gold, formed in supernovae or neutron star collisions, should contain strangelets if Strange Matter were stable, but this is not observed.

Quantum Fluctuations and Stability: Neutrons contain quarks that fluctuate due to quantum mechanics, including strange quarks. However, these do not convert neutrons into Strange Matter, suggesting its stability is context-dependent.
